This document explains bringing up enabling TMP105 and TMP421 I2C device support
in Qemu.

Steps:
=====

1) Enable TMP105(Bus addr 0x49) and TMP421(Bus addr 0x19) in Qemu by writing
   -> Select TMP105 and TMP421 in Kconfig present in qemu/hw/i386 in the config Q35 CPU
		section
2) Enable User space I2C support, HWMON, LM25 for TMP105 and TMP421 drivers in the kernel
3) Install sensors package in the RFS or build for Ubuntu etc
4) To instantiate a device do the following:
	sudo bash -c "echo tmp421 0x1c > new_device" where new_device file is present in
	/sys/bus/i2c/device
5) To delete the device do the following:
	sudo bash -c "echo 0x1c > delete_device" where delete_device is present in
	/sys/bus/i2c/device
6) To startup with the following devices attached to I2C bus give the following command: 
	sudo bin/debug/native/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -M q35,kernel-irqchip=split -device intel-iommu,intremap=on -kernel ../mainline_kernel/arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage -hda ../rfs_images/ubuntu_rfs/disco.img  -nographic -append "console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda nokaslr" -L pc-bios -enable-kvm -m 1G -smp 2 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 -netdev tap,id=net0,vhost=on,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no -runas `whoami` -device tmp105,id=sensor,address=0x49 -device tmp421,id=sensor1,address=0x1c
7) Run command --> sensors to verify the list of SMBUS sensors. Following is the sample output:
		
		tmp105-i2c-0-49
		Adapter: SMBus I801 adapter at 0700
		temp1:         +0.0°C  (high =  +0.0°C, hyst =  +0.0°C)
		
		tmp421-i2c-0-1c
		Adapter: SMBus I801 adapter at 0700
		temp1:         +0.0°C  
		temp2:         +0.0°C
8) Before enabling and trying out things make sure you have the following options enabled
   in the kernel:

	a) CONFIG_I2C_I801
	b) CONFIG_I2C_ISCH
	c) CONFIG_I2C_ISMT
	d) CONFIG_SENSORS_TMP421 (TMP421)
	e) CONFIG_SENSORS_LM25 (TMP105)

9) Enable Tracing:
   ==============
	a) Add event in a events file with each even per line. In case of i2c the events are
		present in hw/i2c/trace-events
      For eg you can add a trace event i2c_event in the events file
    b) During startup add a --trace = <dir>/events file
    c) You can also add events in the Qemu monitor. Do a -> trace-event i2c_* on to enable
       wildcard i2c events
    d) In another command line to view the trace events do a
       $ bin/debug/native/scripts/simpletrace.py bin/debug/native/trace-events-all \
			 trace-<qemu_pid> | grep i2c
	e) Do some simple I2C transactions like i2cdetect or instantiate a device like above
	   and run sensors command to generate i2c events
    f) You will not be able to see i2c events in the file if you do not flush the
       trace-events file. To do this do -> $ trace-file flush
	   which will flush the events to the file. (Wasted a lot of time as the trace file
	   was empty)

	Trace build setup:
    =================
	a) To enable trace in the build use the following:
		$ ./../../configure --enable-debug --enable-trace-backends=simple
